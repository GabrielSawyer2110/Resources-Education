<p>Started this GitHub for a wide variety of reasons, but mainly to track and record work I've done over the past year on establishing my in progress non-profit for better student support, equity, and success. Other reasons would include getting used to, and developing skills, Github. </p>

<p>This will be for documenting my work; all-encompassing planning for my foundation and the direction of marketing, structure, organizational governing documents, as well as both short- and long-term vision/mission. Planning will be a significant part of this, as I'm ever-evolving with the direction and objectives when it comes to short-term goals and business strategies. Brainstorming, probably just on my own, will definitely be apart of this and would fall under planning and tracking, or at least could. </p>

<a id="self-directed" class="anchor" href="#self-directed" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Self-Directed</h3>

<p>I'm a self-directed learner, and unfortunately, my experiences over the past year have caused me to lose a lot of trust in people, both generally and personally. So, I started on the venture back in December (Originally using Muse), to learn front-end web development. However, I overlooked and underestimated the extreme depth and importance of programming so I will be tracking that skills development as well--which will lead to dynamic planning with my website and database/resource structures. I will also create a blog, a resource center for students, email newsletter with subscribers database and so on.</p>
