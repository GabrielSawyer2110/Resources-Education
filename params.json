{"name":"iEducated Foundation: Resources, Development, and Investments","tagline":"Created by a Student, for the Student","body":"# Resources-Development-Investments-Planning-Tracking-Brainstorming for iEducated Foundation.\r\n\r\nStarted this GitHub for a wide variety of reasons, but mainly to track and record work I've done over the past year on establishing my in progress non-profit for better student support, equity, and success. Other reasons would include getting used to, and developing skills, Github. \r\n\r\n## Tracking, Planning, and Brainstorming\r\n\r\nThis will be for documenting my work; all-encompassing planning for my foundation and the direction of marketing, structure, organizational governing documents, as well as both short- and long-term vision/mission. Planning will be a significant part of this, as I'm ever-evolving with the direction and objectives when it comes to short-term goals and business strategies. Brainstorming, probably just on my own, will definitely be apart of this and would fall under planning and tracking, or at least could. \r\n\r\n### Self-Directed\r\n\r\nI'm a self-directed learner, and unfortunately, my experiences over the past year have caused me to lose a lot of trust in people, both generally and personally. So, I started on the venture back in December (Originally using Muse), to learn front-end web development. However, I overlooked and underestimated the extreme depth and importance of programming so I will be tracking that skills development as well--which will lead to dynamic planning with my website and database/resource structures. I will also create a blog, a resource center for students, email newsletter with subscribers database and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Potential-Taglines\r\n> Created by a Student, for the Students.\r\n> Creating Social Investment Opportunities for Student Equity and Support\r\n> Providing Research that re-defines Sociological Standards. \r\n> Ending the Growing Epidemic of Student Homelessness\r\n`                   *Over 310,000 Student Youth reported in California-- 21% of the Nation's total.\r\n>Creating innovative structures and collaborative environments.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
